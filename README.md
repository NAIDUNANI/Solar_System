# Solar System Website

## Description
This project was created as part of a hackathon conducted by Teks Academy, where our team of three collaborated to build an educational website about the solar system. The website provides detailed information on the planets, space missions, and other significant details related to our solar system.

## Project Overview
Our team divided the project into several parts:

- **Index Page and Home Page**: Developed by me, these pages serve as the introductory landing pages for users, welcoming them to explore the solar system and providing navigation to key sections.
- **Planetary Information**: Each planet's characteristics, including size, atmosphere, distance from the sun, and unique features.
- **Space Missions**: Historical and ongoing missions to explore various planets and celestial bodies within the solar system.

## Features
- **Planet Details**: Users can learn about each planet, its atmosphere, temperature, and other scientific facts.
- **Mission History**: A chronological list of past, present, and planned missions to various celestial bodies in our solar system.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed to engage users with visuals and interactive elements.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML,CSS, JavaScript**: For the core structure, styling, and interactivity of the site.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive layout and design consistency across devices.

## Hackathon Team
A team of three participants, where responsibilities were divided to ensure efficient and high-quality development of the project.
